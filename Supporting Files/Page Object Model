PAGE OBJECT MODEL in JS


1. Ensure that class can be exported
When creating a class, at the end of it, after closing curly brackets of a class type the following:

            module.exports = new <name of the class>;

2. Create a constructor
Constructor is something that gets automatically executed when instance of a class is created.
Good practice is to place a driver constructor so the driver gets called every time when
instance of a class is instantiated.

            constructor() {
            var driver = new webdriver.Builder().forBrowser('chrome').build();
            }

3. Make sure that the driver will have the ability to be re-used outside
of a scope of constructor. To do this, create a varible outside of constructor instead.

            vad driver;

            constructor() {
            driver = new webdriver.Builder().forBrowser('chrome').build();
            }
